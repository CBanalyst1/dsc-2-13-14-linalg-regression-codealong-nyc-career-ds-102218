    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we have seen that in statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships among data entities (variables). Linear regression is a highly important predictive analytical tool that most data scientists use in their routine analyses. Here we shall try to develop a basic intuition for regression from a linear algebra perspective using vectors and matrices operations, quite similar to what we saw in previous lessons and labs. This lesson covers least squares regression with matrix algebra without digging deep into the geometric dimensions. \n",
    "[You are advised to follow this link for a deeper mathematical and geometric understanding of the topic](http://math.mit.edu/~gs/linearalgebra/ila0403.pdf). Here we shall try to keep things in a more data oriented domain.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",

    "You will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Understand the role of linear algebra towards regression modeling\n",
    "* Apply linear algebra to fit a function to data, describing linear mappings between input and output variables\n",
    "* Develop simple linear algebraic models for simple and multivariate regression\n"

    "We know that the purpose of regression process is to fit a mathematical model to a set of observed points, in order to later use that model for predicting new values e.g. predicting sales, based on historical sales figures, predicting house prices based on different features of the house etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use a very simple toy example to understand how this works with linear algebra. Say we are collecting data on total number sales per day for some business. Imagine we have got three data points in the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "(day, total number of sales(in hundreds)) \n",
    "\n",
    "> (1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose of linear regression would be to fit a mathematical model (a straight line) in the parameter space  that best describes the relationship between day and sales. Simple linear regression attempts to fit a line (in a 2 dimensional space) to describe the relationship between data variables as shown in the example below:\n",

    "Following this, if we were to identify a relationship between the day and total number of sales, our goal would be to seek a function that describes this line, and allows us to linearly map input data points (day) or **independent variable** to outcome values (sales) or **dependent variable** . For this, we first assume that there is an underlying relationship that maps “days” uniquely to “number of sales”, that can be written in the function form as an equation of the straight line i.e. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "$$y = mx+c$$\n",
    "</center>\n",
    "where `c` is the intercept of the line and `m` denotes the slope, as shown below: \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "We can write the fitting function based on above as sales being a **function** of days.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***sales = f (days)***\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in more general terms \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "So using this, we can show our three data points ((1, 1) , (2, 2) , (3, 2)) as:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> **C + 3(D) = 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that our data points do not lie on a line. The first two points make a perfect linear system. When x = 1, y = 1; and when x = 2, y = 2 i.e. we can draw a straight line passing through these points. When x = 3, b = 2, we  know the three points do not lie on the same line as first two points, and our model will be an **approximation** i.e. \n",
    "> there would be some error between our line and the REAL relationship between these parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "This behavior is can be simulated by using numpy's `polyfit()` function (similar to statsmodels ols) to draw a regression line to our data points as shown below. [Here is the documentation for np.polyfit()](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html). \n",

If we don't include this constant value, then our function will have to go through the origin (0,0), which would seriously limit the types of relationships the model could describe. In machine learning, the size, or **weight**, of bias will be inferred by the learning algorithm. The 1s is just an arbitrary number that forms a basis for learning what the bias is going to be. (Visit the link at the bottom to learn more on this)\n",

    "This says to get y (sales), multiply each X by the appropriate vector b (unknowns),then add error term. We create a matrix X, which has an extra column of 1s in it for the intercept. For each day, the 1 is used to add the intercept in the first row of the column vector b.\n",

We saw a toy example in the case of simple linear regression , relating days to number of sales and calculated a function that approximates the linear mapping. We also introduced the case of multiple input variables for the case of multiple regression and described it as matrix algebra. In th next lab, we shall use these equations to solve a real world problem. "
